# linux-cinnamon-grouped-window-list-fork
Adds extra options to the grouped window list plugin for the Cinnamon desktop enviroment

- So far, I have added the option to change the spacing between the application buttons, as well as inside of them (margin & padding)
- Also looking to add:
  - Change the position of the indicator (top, left, right, bottom)
- Don't run the installer/uninstaller with sudo! You will be prompted for a password after you run the script.
