# linux-cinnamon-grouped-window-list-fork
Adds extra options to the grouped window list plugin for the Cinnamon desktop enviroment

- So far, I have added the option to change the spacing between the application buttons, as well as inside of them (margin & padding)
- Also looking to add:
  - Change the position of the indicator (top, left, right, bottom)


## Installtion
- Based on your Linux Mint Cinnamon version, copy/move the "grouped-window-list@cinnamon.org" folder to the main folder (where the install script is)
- To run the scirpt, open a terminal in the folder install.sh is in and run "bash install.sh"
  - Don't run the installer/uninstaller with sudo! You will be prompted for a password after you run the script!
- After install, either restart Cinnamon or log out to take effect
- To uninstall, simply run the uninstall.sh script - the same way as install.sh
